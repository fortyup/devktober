- **Bonus:** Dynamic crosshair and trajectory prediction

### Day 9 - Platformer with double jump and dash
**Challenge:** Extend day 1's platformer with advanced movements.
- **Skills:** State machine, cooldowns, momentum
- **Bonus:** Visual effects for dash and particles

### Day 10 - Game with magnetic objects
**Challenge:** Player can attract or repel metallic objects.
- **Skills:** Physical forces, influence zones, visual feedback
- **Bonus:** Different material types (metal, wood, plastic)

### Day 11 - Game with inverted gravity
**Challenge:** Allow player to invert gravity at will.
- **Skills:** Physics2D.gravity manipulation, camera rotation
- **Bonus:** Smooth transition and visual effects

### Day 12 - Timing-based game
