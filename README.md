# DevKtober 🎮

Welcome to **DevKtober**, the game development version of Inktober for Unity!

## What is DevKtober?

DevKtober is inspired by the famous Inktober, but here, each day in October, the challenge is to create a prototype, feature, or asset for a video game using Unity.

## Rules

- 1 day = 1 creation (script, asset, prototype, etc.)
- Share your daily progress (screenshots, GIFs, videos, code)
- The goal: progress, experiment, and have fun!

## How to participate? 🚀

1. Fork this repo or create your own.
2. Follow the daily program (see below).
3. Create your projects in the corresponding folders.
4. Publish your daily creations with screenshots/GIFs/videos.
5. Share on social media with the hashtag **#DevKtober**.

## Tips for Success 💡

### ⏰ Time Management
- **Timeboxing**: Limit yourself to 2-4h per day maximum
- **MVP First**: Implement the core mechanic first
- **Polish at the end**: 80% gameplay, 20% polish

### 🛠️ Technical Approach
- **Rapid prototyping**: Use simple geometric shapes
- **Test frequently**: Build and test every 30 minutes
- **Version control**: Commit your progress regularly

### 📱 Sharing and Documentation
- **Screenshots/GIFs**: Capture your "aha!" moments
- **Learning notes**: Document what you discover each day
- **Code snippets**: Share interesting solutions

### 🎮 Game Design
- **Fun first**: Simple but fun > complex but boring
- **Immediate feedback**: Player must understand their actions
- **Rapid iteration**: Test → Feedback → Improvement
