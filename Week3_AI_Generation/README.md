# ü§ñ Week 3 ‚Äì AI & Generation

**Week objective:** Implement basic artificial intelligence and procedural generation systems.

This week explores the fascinating world of game AI: thinking enemies, self-creating environments, and challenges that adapt to the player.

## üéØ Week challenges

### Day 15 - Enemy that chases the player
**Challenge:** Create an enemy that intelligently tracks the player.
- **Skills:** Basic pathfinding, Vector math, AI states
- **Bonus:** Trajectory prediction and obstacle avoidance

### Day 16 - Patrolling enemy
**Challenge:** An enemy follows a predefined path and reacts to the player.
- **Skills:** Waypoint system, state transitions, detection zones
- **Bonus:** Different behaviors based on distance to player

### Day 17 - Procedural terrain generation
**Challenge:** Automatically create varied 2D levels.
- **Skills:** Perlin noise, tile generation, level algorithms
- **Bonus:** Different biomes and placement rules

### Day 18 - Random enemy waves
**Challenge:** Spawn enemy waves with progressive difficulty.
- **Skills:** Wave management, spawn patterns, difficulty scaling
- **Bonus:** Enemy types with unique behaviors

### Day 19 - Minimalist Tower Defense
**Challenge:** Towers automatically shoot at passing enemies.
- **Skills:** Auto-targeting, path following, resource management
- **Bonus:** Upgrade system and tower types

### Day 20 - Boss with simple pattern
**Challenge:** A boss with predictable but challenging attacks.
- **Skills:** Complex state machine, attack patterns, telegraphing
- **Bonus:** Multiple phases and combined attacks

### Day 21 - Hide and seek with field of vision
**Challenge:** AI that searches for player with limited vision.
- **Skills:** Line of sight, cone vision, search behaviors
- **Bonus:** Alert system and AI cooperation

## üí° Tips for the week

1. **Start with the simplest state**: A static enemy before it moves
2. **Visualize states**: Use colors to debug AI
3. **Test AI differently**: Predictable vs unpredictable behavior
4. **Think about performance**: AI can be computationally expensive

## üß† AI concepts to master

- **State Machines**: Foundation of all game AI
- **Pathfinding**: A* algorithm or Navigation Mesh
- **Behavior Trees**: For more complex AI
- **Steering Behaviors**: Natural and fluid movement

## üåç Procedural generation

- **Noise Functions**: Perlin, Simplex for natural patterns
- **Cellular Automata**: For caves and organic spaces
- **Wave Function Collapse**: Constrained and coherent generation
- **Grammar-based**: Rules for complex structures
