## 💡 Tips for the week

1. **Think systems**: How do different elements interact?
2. **Prioritize fun**: Simple but fun > complex but boring
3. **Test balance**: Is it too easy? Too difficult?
4. **Care for feedback**: Does the player understand what's happening?

## 🏗️ System architecture

- **Component System**: Modularity and reusability
- **Event System**: Decentralized communication
- **State Management**: Global game consistency
- **Save/Load System**: Data persistence

## 🎮 Useful design patterns

- **Observer Pattern**: For events and notifications
- **Command Pattern**: For actions and undo/redo
- **Factory Pattern**: For dynamic object creation
- **Singleton Pattern**: For global managers (in moderation!)

## 🎯 Game Design considerations

- **Core Loop**: What brings the player back?
- **Progression**: How does the player improve?
- **Feedback**: How to communicate game state?
- **Balance**: How to maintain challenge?
